# Existing code and proposed validation changes

Status: **PROPOSED**. This mapping is based on repository commit
`e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3`, the unchanged product-code base of
this documentation proposal. It identifies reuse candidates and observed limits;
it is not an implementation plan with a fixed API or an exhaustive validator audit.

## Reuse and adaptation

| Existing component | Proposed use | Required adaptation or verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`internal/xsdgen/generate_validation.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/internal/xsdgen/generate_validation.go), generated score and opus schemas | Reuse schema extraction and generated contract data where verified | Preserve source IDs and version fingerprints; map generated facts to the shared catalog without creating a second independent XSD rule set |
| [`matchParticle` and related matchers](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L1747-L1952) | Candidate shared content-grammar operators | Verify sequence/choice, repetitions, nullable branches, and resource bounds against the catalog |
| [`validateSimple`, `validateBuiltin`, and facet helpers](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L1080-L1745) | Candidate scalar-domain operators | Verify exact value spaces, union normalization, pattern semantics and facet layers; remove confusion between bounded Go representation and unbounded XSD integer domains |
| [`validateAttributes`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L889-L984) | Reuse permitted/required/default/fixed attribute logic | Cover attributes on simple-typed elements as well as complex types; implement the separate contracts for all four standard xsi attributes |
| [`recordIdentity` and `validateIdentityReferences`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L1018-L1078) | Reuse document-wide ID indexing and reference resolution | Add prose-defined target kinds and part/instrument/player scope; ID existence alone is insufficient |
| [`newDocumentDecoder`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/decode.go#L147-L183), [`xml_decoder.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/xml_decoder.go), [`xml_namespace.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/xml_namespace.go) | Feed source facts and model decoding from the same XML parse | Observe unfiltered expanded names and attributes before permissive filtering; enforce the missing XML checks and finish at EOF |
| Current [`Validate`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L70-L125) | Preserve an explicit model-validation entry point while adapting its implementation | Replace its Encode → parse route with a direct model-fact adapter. This requirement does not imply discarding every existing matcher or scalar helper |
| [`mxl.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/mxl.go#L173-L329), [`options.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/options.go), [`document_depth.go`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/document_depth.go) | Retain useful package checks, XML/MXL budgets, and model traversal guards | Map existing path, mimetype, container/rootfile, depth, and cycle checks to appropriate categories; do not claim full ZIP/JAR semantics |

The target is one shared rule implementation with source and model adapters.
Reuse is contract-by-contract. Neither a wholesale rewrite nor the sufficiency
of the current XSD engine is assumed.

## Confirmed limits of the current implementation

Focused review probes at the pinned code base showed the following. They
identify work for a later implementation change; this documentation does not
repair these behaviors.

- **Attributes on simple-typed elements:** unrecognized attributes on `staves`
  and `step`, such as `rubbish="x"`, pass the internal source-validation path.
  [`validateType`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L569-L620)
  checks text and children in its simple/builtin branches but calls attribute
  validation only through the complex-type branch. This is narrower than saying
  all simple attribute values are unchecked: complex-type attributes such as
  `measure/@implicit="maybe"` are correctly rejected.
- **XML well-formedness:** duplicate attributes and a DOCTYPE inside the root
  are accepted by the current decoding/internal parsing paths. These belong to
  the mandatory XML layer, regardless of the strict MusicXML flag.
- **xsi semantics:** `xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation` is rejected as an unallowed
  attribute by the current source path. The proposed fix is the standard
  attribute contract, not blanket acceptance of every xsi value. `xsi:type`
  and `xsi:nil` also require their own semantic checks.
- **Integer value space:** `staves=18446744073709551616` is accepted by libxml2
  against the pinned schema but rejected by the current scalar checker.
  Its [`ParseInt`/unsigned parsing branches](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L1410-L1440)
  use machine-width limits even for unbounded XSD integer families. A Go-model
  representation limit must not be reported as a normative XSD violation.
- **Additional prose conditions:** a `part/@id` pointing at an ID of the wrong
  kind, an empty `accordion-registration`, and duplicate beam numbers on one
  note pass current validation. They demonstrate concrete needs beyond generic
  IDREF and structural XSD checks.

## Model evidence that can and cannot be supplied

The adapter must describe capabilities per field and rule, not promise that
all source information survives except for a short list of lexical details.

| Model feature | Evidence available or lost |
| --- | --- |
| Optional pointer fields | Usually preserve omitted versus present values; `Effective...` methods expose defaults without mutating omission |
| Required non-pointer scalars | May lose source presence: a missing `octave` becomes the zero value after Decode and can pass current model validation |
| Singular fields | May lose source multiplicity: repeated `octave` elements collapse during Decode and can pass current model validation |
| Ordered `Content` slices | Preserve the represented interleaving, subject to decoder filtering; this is not evidence for discarded nodes |
| Fixed struct-field sequences | Describe current model/export order, not necessarily historical source order |
| Integers | Exact only within the concrete Go type's range; original integer lexical form is not preserved |
| Decimal fields | `float64` can lose exact decimal values and lexical forms |
| Foreign/unknown nodes, duplicate attributes, declarations and directives | Discarded or normalized input cannot be reconstructed from the current model |

A direct model check evaluates the current object state. It must not claim
that a missing or repeated original scalar was absent/present exactly once.
Where a current model actually represents an absent required child or attribute,
that remains a normative required/minOccurs violation, not merely an internal
model error. Insufficient evidence for an applicable obligation must be surfaced
as incomplete/unknown/unsupported rather than silently treated as a pass.

## Existing tests and security behavior

[`TestEncodedCorpusConformsToMusicXMLSchema`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/external_validation_test.go#L47-L87)
checks 146 fixtures after **Decode → Encode**, then supplies the exported bytes
to `xmllint --nonet`. This is useful evidence about generated output. It is not
proof that arbitrary original source XML is fully validated by the library.
Corpus regression and rule-by-rule source/model coverage answer different
questions.

The present `encoding/xml` route does not automatically fetch external DTDs,
entities, or schemas, and does not expand XInclude. Retain this no-network
invariant when adding schema-location handling, linked documents, or external
dictionaries. Existing XML depth, five MXL byte budgets, model depth, and opus
cycle checks are useful safeguards. Broader diagnostic/scalar/attribute budgets
and cancellation remain proposed work.

## Error compatibility proposal

Preserve existing sentinel identities and observable `errors.Is`/`errors.As`
behavior where their meanings still apply, while attaching richer diagnostic
categories. This is a proposed compatibility policy for review, not a completed
API commitment. A future migration must test existing callers and document any
necessary change explicitly.

- [`ValidationError.Unwrap`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/validation.go#L61-L64)
  currently exposes `ErrInvalidDocument`. Preserve that recognition for genuine
  validation failures while making individual diagnoses more precise.
- [`ErrXMLTooDeep`, `ErrDocumentTooDeep`, and `ErrMXLTooLarge`](https://github.com/go-muse/go-musicxml/blob/e486735cd6e4537e839ff67704b7768a9df3bdb3/errors.go)
  represent resource limits; they do not by themselves prove malformed XML or
  a normatively invalid model. Existing wrapping relationships may need to
  coexist with a more accurate new category.
- `ErrDocumentCycle` identifies a model-graph problem. `UnsupportedRootError`
  identifies an unsupported root/profile and is not necessarily malformed XML.
- The current `representation` issue can include an Encode failure. A direct
  adapter should distinguish model invariants, numeric representability, and
  normative violations rather than treating that catch-all as the final design.
- Unknown, unsupported, and blocked-by-invalid-prerequisite outcomes need explicit
  reporting. An incomplete assessment must not become a successful conformance
  claim merely because no violation was found.

## First implementation candidates

A first increment can start with local presence/value relations and typed IDREFs.
The 51 constraint records partition into five fully overlapping XSD records,
eight dictionary-dependent records (seven SMuFL, one IPA), nine MXL records,
and **29 remaining candidate records**. These sets are disjoint in this snapshot.
The remaining applicability is 27 `both`, one `source`, and one `exporter`.
This is a planning filter, not 29 proven independent executable predicates.

Useful early candidates are `accordion-at-least-one`, `beam-number-distinct`,
typed instrument/part/player targets, `key-octave-cancel-exists`,
`concert-score-transpose`, and `for-part-requires-concert`. Each still needs an
exact selector, prerequisites, target capabilities, and positive/negative/boundary
cases before becoming executable.

`written-transposition` needs instrument/intent context. `chord-duration-bound`
requires a defined principal-note/duration relation, and `numeral-requires-key`
needs effective key state in musical order and staff context. A comprehensive
timeline can be staged later, but a selected rule's mandatory dependencies
cannot be omitted or guessed.

Renderer/exporter labels are not automatic exclusion from validation work.
Defaults and interpretations can supply context facts; exporter recommendations
can be optional advisories; some obligations need external intent or application
state. Assign the execution/reporting role per record during formalization.
